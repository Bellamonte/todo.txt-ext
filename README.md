# Todo.txt Extension for Thunderbird

Thunderbird extension for the Todo.txt application. This extension tries to integrate the Todo.txt application with Thunderbird. Using the Lightning extension it is now possible to add, delete or modify todo's directly within Thunderbird.

## Functionality

* Add, delete or modify Todo's from within your Thunderbird
* Automatically use Thunderbirds functions from Todo.txt, such as categories and priorities.
* Get a quick overview of all your tasks.
* Search for complete and incomplete Todo's within Thunderbird using search paramaters such as Contexts or Projects.

# Thanks

This project was made possible of the following projects:

* This extension relies heavily on the [todo-txt-js](https://github.com/roufamatic/todo-txt-js) library.
* Much of the code was inspired on the [StormCows](https://github.com/moldybeats/stormcows) extension.
